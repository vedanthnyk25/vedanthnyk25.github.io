## Status: In Progress 🛠️
I am currently building this to solve the problem of missing webhook events during server downtime or network issues.

## Planned Features
- **Ingestion Buffer**: A high-throughput Go-based ingestion layer.
- **Replay Logic**: One-click redelivery of failed webhooks.
- **Inspection UI**: A dashboard built with Next.js to inspect headers and payloads of every incoming request.
