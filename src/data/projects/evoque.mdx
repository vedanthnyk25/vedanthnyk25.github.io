## Overview
Evoque is a backend-heavy project designed to simulate the complexities of a ride-sharing service. It focuses on service decoupling, efficient data flow, and low-latency communication between the passenger and driver services.

## Key Features
- **Microservices Architecture**: Built with independent services for drivers, trips, and payments using Go.
- **Real-time Communication**: Utilizes WebSockets for live ride status notifications.
- **Containerization**: Fully Dockerized environment for consistent deployment and local development.
